**Status:** Active Development

## Overview

Shift is a specialized coaching management platform designed for figure skating coaches to streamline their business operations. The platform focuses on automating administrative tasks, managing client relationships, and providing secure billing and scheduling tools.

---

## Key MVP Goals

1. **Time Savings:** Reduce administrative work from 8-10 hours/week to <2 hours/week
2. **Communication Separation:** Automated reminders (lessons, invoices) come from Shift's dedicated system, keeping personal parent-coach communication focused on coaching conversations
3. **Revenue Protection:** Automated billing ensures no billable hours are lost
4. **Professional Boundaries:** 24-hour cancellation policies automatically enforced
5. **User Validation:** Prove market fit with 180-day free trial period for early adopters

## Monetization Strategy

### Subscription Model (SaaS)

Shift uses a **subscription-based revenue model** powered by Stripe for coach billing only. Coaches pay for access to the platform to manage their business operations.

**180-Day Free Trial:**
- All new coaches receive a **180-day (6-month) free trial** upon signup
- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This extended trial period is **temporary** and designed specifically for initial app validation with early adopters
- Once the app is more fully developed and market fit is validated, the trial period will be **shortened significantly** (likely to 7-14 days)
- During the trial, coaches have full access to all platform features
- At the end of the trial, coaches are prompted to subscribe to continue using Shift
- No credit card required during trial signup

**Subscription Tiers (Post-Trial):**
- **Individual Coach Plan:** $8-10/month
  - Full access to client management, scheduling, and automated billing
  - Unlimited clients and lessons
  - Automated SMS reminders
  - Invoice generation and tracking

- **Team Plan (Future):** $20-25/month
  - All Individual Plan features
  - Multi-coach collaboration
  - Shared client roster
  - Team progress notes and handoffs
  - Centralized billing dashboard

**Payment Processing:**
- Stripe Checkout handles all subscription payments
- Recurring monthly billing
- Secure card storage and PCI compliance handled by Stripe
- Webhooks for automated subscription status updates

## Client-to-Coach Payments

**IMPORTANT:** Shift does **NOT** process client-to-coach payments for lessons or services.

**Payment Method:**
- Coaches use **peer-to-peer (P2P) payment links** like Venmo for client billing
- Invoices generated by Shift include the coach's Venmo link (or other P2P link)
- Clients pay the coach directly via Venmo, Zelle, PayPal, etc.
- Coaches manually mark invoices as "paid" in Shift after receiving payment

**Why This Approach:**
- Avoids payment processing fees on lesson payments
- Simplifies compliance and legal requirements
- Leverages existing P2P payment adoption
- Keeps Shift focused on management/automation, not payment processing
- Reduces platform liability for client-coach financial disputes

## Revenue Model Summary

| Revenue Stream | Method | Purpose |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| **Coach Subscriptions** | Stripe recurring billing | Platform access fee for coaches |
| **Client Lesson Payments** | P2P links (Venmo, Zelle) | Direct coach-to-client payments (NOT processed by Shift) |
