| **Location** | Suburban metropolitan area with multiple rinks/clubs |
| **Income** | Middle-to-upper class, primarily freelance/lesson-based income |
| **Tech Savvy** | High (Mobile-first generation) |

---

### Professional Context

**Current Situation:**
- Full-time professional figure skating coach
- Works as secondary coach on a team structure
- Takes 10-15 private clients on the side
- Manages dual coaching responsibilities (team + private)
- Freelance income model (paid per lesson)

**Work Environment:**
- On ice 6-8 hours per day
- Multiple rink locations
- Irregular hours (early mornings, evenings, weekends)
- High-energy, physically demanding work
- Limited time between lessons for administrative tasks

---

### Goals & Motivations

#### Primary Goals

1. **Maximize Billable Hours**
   - Wants to spend 90% of time on the ice coaching
   - Minimize unpaid administrative work
   - Focus energy on athlete development, not paperwork

2. **Professionalize Her Brand**
   - All client interactions (scheduling, billing) should look polished
   - Move away from personal phone for business communication
   - Build reputation as organized, professional coach

3. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Easily share athlete progress with other specialty coaches
   - Track long-term development without endless meetings
   - Ensure nothing falls through the cracks

4. **Work-Life Balance**
   - Leave work at the rink
   - Protect personal time from constant client texts
   - Automate repetitive weekly tasks

---

### Challenges & Pain Points

#### Administrative Overload
- **Time Drain:** Spends 8-10 hours per week outside of the rink on:
  - Manual scheduling coordination
  - Creating and sending invoices
  - Payment follow-up and tracking
  - Responding to scheduling texts
- **Opportunity Cost:** Every hour on admin is one less hour coaching (or resting)
- **Burnout Risk:** Administrative burden creating work-life imbalance

#### Payment Collection Friction
- **Manual Tracking:** Coaching multiple students makes it very difficult to track all billable hours
- **Payment Chase:** Must manually follow up on unpaid invoices
- **Awkward Conversations:** Uncomfortable asking for money repeatedly
- **Lost Revenue:** Sometimes forgets to bill for makeup lessons or last-minute sessions

#### Scheduling Chaos (Team Environment)
- **Coordination Complexity:** Must align her schedule with:
  - Head Coach's demands
  - 20+ athletes' availability
  - Other specialty coaches' schedules
  - Rink ice time availability
- **Communication Overload:** Endless group texts and emails
- **Double-Booking Risk:** No centralized system leads to conflicts

#### Communication Overload
- **Personal Texts Dominated by Admin Messages:** Text threads with parents are cluttered with:
  - Lesson reminders she has to manually send
  - Payment requests and invoice follow-ups
  - Schedule confirmations and change notifications
  - These transactional messages drown out meaningful coaching conversations
- **Wants to Text Parents, Not Spam Them:** Values direct communication about athlete progress and coaching strategy
- **Transactional vs. Relational:** Needs separation between automated reminders (transactional) and personal coaching discussions (relational)
- **No Professional Boundary:** All business communication mixed with personal messages

#### Progress Tracking Gaps
- **Memory-Based System:** Relies on memory for what each athlete needs to work on
- **No Handoff Process:** Difficult to coordinate with other specialty coaches
- **Inconsistent Notes:** Sometimes forgets to write post-lesson notes
- **No Longitudinal View:** Hard to see long-term athlete development

---

### Job-to-be-Done (JTBD)

> **"When I finish my week of coaching, I want an automated system to finalize my billing, send all client invoices, and schedule my next week of lessons by viewing my clients' availability so I can leave the rink and focus only on my personal time."**

#### JTBD Breakdown

**Situation:** End of a busy coaching week
**Motivation:** Wants to transition from work mode to personal time
**Expected Outcome:** All administrative tasks completed automatically
**Success Criteria:**
- All lessons billed correctly
- All invoices sent to clients
- Next week's schedule confirmed
- Can leave rink without administrative guilt

---

### Current Workflow & Workarounds

#### Scheduling
- **Tools:** Shared Excel sheet with Head Coach (team) + Google Calendar (private clients)
- **Process:**
  1. Receives text from parent with availability
  2. Checks Excel sheet for conflicts
  3. Manually adds to Google Calendar
  4. Texts confirmation back to parent
  5. Updates Excel sheet for team visibility
- **Pain:** 5-step process for each lesson scheduled

#### Communication
- **Tools:** Personal mobile phone (SMS/Texting)
- **Process:**
  - Constant text threads with 15+ parents
  - Manual reminder texts before each lesson
  - Last-minute cancellation texts
  - Progress update texts after lessons
- **Pain:** Personal phone constantly buzzing with work messages

#### Payment Tracking
- **Tools:** Separate spreadsheet for billing
- **Process:**
  1. Logs each lesson in spreadsheet after coaching
  2. Manually calculates total hours at end of week/month
  3. Creates invoice in Word document
  4. Emails invoice to client
  5. Accepts Zelle/Venmo payment
  6. Updates spreadsheet to mark as "paid"
  7. Sends follow-up text if unpaid after 1 week
- **Pain:** Extremely manual, error-prone, time-consuming

#### Lesson Planning & Notes
- **Tools:** Paper notebook + phone notes app
- **Process:**
  - Scribbles quick notes between lessons
  - Sometimes loses paper notes
  - No organized system for long-term tracking
- **Pain:** Inconsistent, hard to reference, not shareable

- Value of automated billing is substantial (prevents lost revenue)
- Professional SMS communication adds significant value
- Would pay more for team collaboration features

**Price Sensitivity:**

- Values simplicity over feature bloat

---

### Technology Usage

- Text messaging
- Email (less frequently)

**App Preferences:**

5. Revenue analytics

**Deal-Breakers:**
1. Complicated setup or learning curve

### Quote from Coach Brittlyn

> "I love coaching, and I love texting with parents about how their kid is progressing. But I don't love when those conversations are buried under payment reminders and lesson confirmations. If Shift could send those automated messages from its own number, my personal texts with parents could stay focused on actual coaching. That would be huge. I'd pay for that immediately."

- Would pay per-coach pricing ($10/coach/month = $40/month for 4 coaches)
