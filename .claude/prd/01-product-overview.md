## 1. Problem Statement

Figure skating coaches lack a single, specialized, and secure platform to manage their demanding business operations, forcing them to rely on disorganized tools like spreadsheets and personal texts. This administrative fragmentation—from manually coordinating schedules based on client availability to chasing payments—wastes substantial time for both individual coaches and multi-coach teams.

### The Core Issue

The problem is the **failure of existing general sports software** to provide the necessary:
- **Coach-driven scheduling control**
- **Collaborative framework for multi-coach teams**
- **Separation of automated reminders from personal parent-coach communication**
- **Specialized financial tracking for lesson-based billing**

**The Communication Problem:** Coaches' personal text threads with parents are cluttered with administrative reminders (upcoming lessons, payment requests) that distract from meaningful communication about athlete progress and coaching needs. Parents and coaches WANT to communicate directly, but automated business reminders should come from a separate, professional source.

This results in coaches spending 8-10 hours per week on administrative tasks instead of coaching, and their personal phones becoming dominated by transactional rather than relational communication.

## 2. Evidence: Why This is a Problem Worth Solving

### Direct Evidence from Coaches

**Wasted Time:**
- Coaches spend too many unpaid hours outside of the rink chasing payments
- Endless text coordination for lesson scheduling
- Manual schedule building prevents focus on actual coaching

**Failed Solutions:**
- Coaching teams have tried multiple software programs
- None work for figure skating's unique needs
- Teams revert to clunky Excel spreadsheets
- Proves existing apps lack specialization for team coordination and payment tracking

**Communication Chaos:**
- Coaches' personal text threads are overwhelmed with administrative messages
- Lesson reminders, payment requests, and scheduling confirmations clutter personal conversations
- Parents and coaches WANT to communicate about athlete progress and coaching
- But transactional reminders prevent meaningful relational communication
- Urgent need for automated reminders from a separate, professional source
- This allows personal texts to remain focused on coaching conversations

### Market Validation

- Direct experience with professional figure skating coaches
- Conversations reveal this is a widespread industry problem
- Growing, specialized market with clear pain points
- High ROI potential: solving this friction point directly translates to increased efficiency

## 5. Core Hypothesis

**If we build a specialized platform that:**
1. Gives coaches full scheduling control
2. Automates billing and payment tracking
3. Sends automated reminders (lessons, invoices) from a separate, professional source
4. Preserves personal parent-coach communication for coaching conversations
5. Enables team collaboration with role-based access

**Then coaches will:**
