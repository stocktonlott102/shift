## Tax Forms Coaches File

| Form | Purpose | When Required |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Schedule C (Form 1040)** | Report business income and expenses (Profit or Loss from Business) | Always - main form for self-employed income |
| **Schedule SE (Form 1040)** | Calculate self-employment tax (Social Security + Medicare) | If net earnings are $400+ |
| **Form 1040-ES** | Calculate and pay quarterly estimated taxes | If expecting to owe $1,000+ after withholding |
| **1099-NEC** | Received from clients/orgs that paid $600+ | Issued by payer (businesses/orgs, not typically individual parents) |

---

## Income Data Coaches Need to Track

- Total gross receipts from coaching services
- Client name and amount per client (to reconcile against any 1099-NEC forms received)
- Date of each payment
- Payment method (cash, check, Venmo, Zelle, etc.)
- Income by service type/category (private lesson, group class, etc.)

**Key point:** Coaches must report ALL income on Schedule C, not just what appears on 1099 forms. Cash and P2P payments are still taxable.

---

## Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments

Coaches must pay quarterly estimated taxes if they expect to owe $1,000+ for the year.

| Quarter | Period Covered | Payment Deadline |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Q1 | January - March | April 15 |
| Q2 | April - May | June 15 |
| Q3 | June - August | September 15 |
| Q4 | September - December | January 15 (next year) |

**Self-employment tax rate:** 15.3% on net earnings (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare)

**Safe harbor rule:** Pay at least 100% of prior year's tax liability (110% if AGI > threshold) to avoid underpayment penalties.
